## Description
Small tool for the creation and edition of SQLite DB files. Created originally as a coding assignment in one of recruitment processes.

## Getting Started
This section describes briefly how to setup the environment and build the project.

### Prerequisites
Qt in version 6.5 or greater, C++ compiler with C++17 support as a minimum and CMake 3.16+. 

### Building
Clone and use CMake directly or via any IDE supporting it. CMake should:

- configure everything automatically,
- compile and create binaries.

As a result of compilation, binary for simulations and binary for testing should be created.

## Built with
| Tool |  Windows | Ubuntu |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OS version | 10 22H2 | 22.04 |
| GCC | 13.1.0 | 13.2.0 |
| CMake | 3.30.2 | 3.28.3 |
| Git | 2.46.0 | 2.43.0 |
| Qt | 6.5.2 | 6.5.2 |
| Qt Creator | 10.0.2 | 10.0.2 |
| VS Code | 1.92.0 | 1.94.2 |

## Testing
For testing purposes, the QTest framework is used. Build the project first. Make sure that the `sqlite-browser-test` target is built. Modern IDEs supporting CMake also support running tests with monitoring of failures. But in case you would like to run it manually, go to the `build/test` directory, where the‚Å£ binary `sqlite-browser-test` should be available. Launching it should produce the following output on Linux:
Example run:
```
$ ./sqlite-browser-test
********* Start testing of DatabaseConfigTest *********
Config: Using QtTest library 6.5.2, Qt 6.5.2 (x86_64-little_endian-lp64 shared (dynamic) release build; by GCC 10.3.1 20210422 (Red Hat 10.3.1-1)), ubuntu 24.04
PASS   : DatabaseConfigTest::initTestCase()
PASS   : DatabaseConfigTest::testTableName()
PASS   : DatabaseConfigTest::testCreateTableSql()
PASS   : DatabaseConfigTest::testCheckTableSql()
PASS   : DatabaseConfigTest::testColumnNames()
PASS   : DatabaseConfigTest::testUserFriendlyColumnNames()
PASS   : DatabaseConfigTest::cleanupTestCase()
Totals: 7 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0 blacklisted, 1ms
********* Finished testing of DatabaseConfigTest *********

```
As an alternative, CTest can be used to run tests from the `build/test` directory:
```
$ ctest
Test project /home/ja/GitHubProjects/sqlite-browser/build/test
    Start 1: sqlite-browser-test
1/1 Test #1: sqlite-browser-test ..............   Passed    0.01 sec

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 1

Total Test time (real) =   0.01 sec
```

## Licensing
SQLite Browser is published under an MIT license.

The project uses the following software:
| Name | License | Home | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Qt | LGPLv3 | https://www.qt.io/| cross-platform application development framework |

## Potential further improvements
1) Make the creation and usage of database structures fully generic.  
2) Use a JSON file as a DB structure definition, which would fill the DatabaseConfig class.  
3) Fix problems with focus. There are still scenarios when the current item is set on table view, but a row is not selected. It results in the delete row action being active.
